# AndroidWebsiteExtraction
> This prototype was made to extract content from a website without the connection from the database

The idea came when I wanted to show an example of how a company's Website would look like in an Android device. 
Since I didn't have direct access to their database I improvised by getting their content via HTML tags with the help of the jsoup library.
